Design-wise, I want this website to have a modern look - somewhat minimalist, but with a bit of flair to it to make it unique. I used create-react-app to create the initial framework, and react-router to handle routing. Aside from those, I try to stay away from importing libraries. Aside from create-react-app, the React components and HTML/JSX/CSS have been created from scratch.",
