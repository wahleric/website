**Weclome to the repository for my personal website**.

This website was created as a way for me to both showcase and practice my talents as a developer, and to explain a little bit about myself. My goal was to keep this site lightweight, performant, responsive, and accessible. Design-wise, I wanted to keep it simple - somewhat minimalist, but with a little bit of flair to make it something unique.

It was built using React, along with React Router to handle routing. The initial commit was created using `create-react-app`. Aside from that, I try to avoid importing any other libraries. The React components and HTML/JSX/CSS have been created from scratch.
